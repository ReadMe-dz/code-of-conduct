ReadMe-dz is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, or religion.

## Reporting

If you are being harassed by a member of the ReadMe-dz community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact one of the ReadMe-dz team members. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.

This code of conduct applies to ReadMe-dz spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of the ReadMe-dz community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by ReadMe-dz community members seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from the ReadMe-dz community based on their past behavior, including behavior outside ReadMe-dz spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the ReadMe-dz community.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. The ReadMe-dz team are not here to explain power differentials or other basic social justice concepts to you. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of ReadMe-dz members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.


## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the ReadMe-dz team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all ReadMe-dz spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other ReadMe-dz community members or the general public.

## Diversity Statement

ReadMe-dz welcomes and encourages participation by everyone.

No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you. We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our communities.

## Adopt a code of conduct in your community

This code of conduct is largely based on the [*Spectrum's Code of Conduct*](https://github.com/withspectrum/code-of-conduct), and if you would like to adopt a policy similar to this one in your community, we recommend looking at Geek Feminism's [community anti-harassment resources](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Community_anti-harassment), including [a freely reusable and modifiable policy](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Community_anti-harassment/Policy).
